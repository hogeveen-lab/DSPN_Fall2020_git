    "## Goal\n",
    "* In research training, you frequently have to learn new skills on top of managing existing projects.\n",
    "    * Often, totally unclear whether those skills are _definitely_ going to help.\n",
    "        * E.g. ICA fMRI for me.\n",
    "    * My goal: Give you a space to tackle such a challenge with the guarantee of benefitting through course credit.\n",

    "## Suggestions for content and scope:\n",
    "1. Will it benefit your future research?\n",
    "    * If unlikely, back to the drawing board.\n",
    "2. Is it feasible?\n",
    "    * If not, is there a smaller component you can take on?\n",
    "3. Is it a challenge?\n",
    "    * If not, can you expand on it to make it a challenge?\n",
    "\n",
    "## \"What do I submit?\"\n",
    "1. A presentation.\n",
    "    * â‰ˆ10 mins.\n",
    "    * Formats: Any type of visual and/or auditory recording.\n",
    "        * e.g. Narrated pptx, recorded Zoom, etc.\n",
    "2. Any supplementary materials that are relevant to understanding #1.\n",
    "    * Code, figures, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How will I evaluate it\n",
    "* 80% Effort. \n",
    "    * Based on the assignments so far, I have a good idea for individual levels of data science expertise.\n",
    "    * If the assignment clearly exemplifies that you have pushed yourself to advance your training, you'll get full marks here.\n",
    "* 20% Presentation quality.\n",
    "    * Communication is a key component of a (data) scientist's toolkit.\n",
    "    * If you clearly lay out...\n",
    "        * Relevant background\n",
    "        * Specific skill you learned\n",
    "        * What / how you learned\n",
    "    * ...then you will also get full marks here."
